# Integrate Teradata Vantage with KNIME Analytics Platform

## Overview

This how-to describes how to connect to Terdata Vantage from KNIME Analytics Platform.

### About KNIME Analytics Platform

KNIME Analytics Platform is a data science workbench. It supports analytics on various data sources, including Teradata Vantage.

## Prerequisites


import ClearscapeDocsNote from '../_partials/vantage_clearscape_analytics.mdx'

* Access to a Teradata Vantage instance, version 17.10 or higher.
  <ClearscapeDocsNote />
* KNIME installed locally. See [KNIME installation instructions](https://www.knime.com/installation) for details.

## Integration Procedure

1. Go to https://downloads.teradata.com/download/connectivity/jdbc-driver (first time users will need to register) and download the latest version of the JDBC driver.
2. Unzip the downloaded file. You will find `terajdbc4.jar` file.
3. In KNIME, click on `File â†’ Preference`. Under `Databases`, click `Add`:
![Add jar](../other-integrations/images/integrate-teradata-vantage-with-knime/add-jar.png)
4. Register a new database driver. Provide values for `ID`, `Name` and `Description` like below. Click on `Add file` and point to the .jar file you downloaded earlier. Click on the `Find driver classes` and the `Driver class:` should populate with the `jdbc.TeraDriver`:
![Register driver](../other-integrations/images/integrate-teradata-vantage-with-knime/register-driver.png)
5. Click `Apply and Close`:
![Apply and close](../other-integrations/images/integrate-teradata-vantage-with-knime/apply-and-close.png)
6. To test the connection, create a new KNIME workflow and add a `Database Reader (legacy)` node by dragging it to the workspace to the right:
![Test connection step 1](../other-integrations/images/integrate-teradata-vantage-with-knime/test-connection-1.png)
![Test connection step 2](../other-integrations/images/integrate-teradata-vantage-with-knime/test-connection-2.png)
7. Right-click on the `Database Reader (legacy)` to configure settings. Select `com.teradata.jdbc.Teradriver` from the drop-down:
![Start configuration](../other-integrations/images/integrate-teradata-vantage-with-knime/start-configuration.png)
8. Enter the name of the Vantage server and login mechanism, e.g.:
![Enter configuration](../other-integrations/images/integrate-teradata-vantage-with-knime/enter-configuration.png)
9. To test connection, enter SQL statement in box in lower right. For example, enter `SELECT * FROM DBC.DBCInfoV` and click `Apply` to close the dialog:
![Test connection apply](../other-integrations/images/integrate-teradata-vantage-with-knime/test-connection-apply.png)
10. Execute the node to test the connection:
![Execute node](../other-integrations/images/integrate-teradata-vantage-with-knime/execute-node.png)
11. The node will show a green light when run successfully. Right-click and select `Data from Database` to view the results:
![View results](../other-integrations/images/integrate-teradata-vantage-with-knime/view-results.png)
![View results](../other-integrations/images/integrate-teradata-vantage-with-knime/view-results-final.png)
