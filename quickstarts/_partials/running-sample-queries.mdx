## Run sample queries
1. We will now run some queries in the VM. To avoid copy/paste issues between the host and the VM, we will open this quick start in the VM. Go to the virtual desktop, start Firefox and point it to this quick start.
2. Once in Teradata Studio Express, go to `Query Development` perspective (go to the top menu and select `Window` -> `Query Development`).
3. Connect using the previously created connection profile by double-clicking on `Database Connections` -> `New Teradata`.
4. Using `dbc` user, we will create a new database called `HR`. Copy/paste this query and run it by hitting the run query button (image:run.query.button.png[Run Query Button, 24, 24]) or pressing <kbd>[F5]</kbd> key:
