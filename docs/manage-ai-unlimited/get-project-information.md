# Get project information

In the manager, you can see the status of projects, access their Git repositories, and copy a project's IP address (if you ever need it for troubleshooting).

If you are the AI Unlimited owner (meaning, you [set up AI Unlimited](/install-ai-unlimited/setup-ai-unlimited.md)), you see all projects and you can delete any of them. Otherwise, you see and can delete only the projects that you yourself create.

1. Access the manager.

:::note
Get the URL from the AI Unlimited owner at your organization. The owner received the URL after installing the manager.
:::

2. Sign in to GitLab or GitHub.
3. After being routed back to the manager, select **Projects**.
